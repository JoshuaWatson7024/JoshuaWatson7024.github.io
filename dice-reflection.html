        <h1>Dice Roller Reflection</h1>
        <uo>
            <li>
                This project is intented to be a showcase of the skills I have learned so far in CISC275
            </li>
            <li>
                Other than some documented helper functions, the source code is entirely original
            </li>
            <li>
                I organized my files into logical folders
            </li>
            <li>
                I committed often and used specific, single task commits
            </li>
            <li>
                I built the app with react and typeScript
            </li>
            <li>
                I coded the rolling animation by using an asynchronous helper function to periodically pause between displays
            </li>
            <li>
                I structured my code with a die interface, dice class, and diceTable and dataTable components. It is set up such that implementing more dice would be facile
            </li>
            <li>
                I used programming logic in my ts to edit my css in order to cause the cells of the data table to become different shades of blue based on the results distribution (the most rolled number is the most blue)
            </li>
            <li>
                I used css to style the page (background color, green "table", dice image size, positioning of all elements)
            </li>
