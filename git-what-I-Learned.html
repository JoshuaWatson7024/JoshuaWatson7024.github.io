        <h1>What I learned from this
            <a href="https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions/"> article about git</a>

            <li>
                The "repository" is actually inside the hidden .git folder
            </li>
            <li>
                If you just start you cmd line and enter "git init" you'll put your whole hard drive under git control!
            </li>
            <li>
                When you commit a file, you give it to git. At that point, you edit and commit copies that git gives you
            </li>
            <li>
                A commit takes a "snapshot" of the ENTIRE working tree (every file you've committed ever to this repository)
            </li>
            <li>
                "Adding" or "staging" files sends them to the "index" or "stage"
            </li>
            <li>
                git status shows you "what's new"
            </li>
            <li>
                Every commit (except the root commit) has a parent commit, this allows history tracking
            </li>
            <li>
                One commit can have multiple children - this is how you make branches
            </li>
            <li>
                "git switch" will let you switch branches
            </li>
            <li>
                when you "git merge" git creates a new commit with two parents - the last commit of the working tree and the specified tree
            </li>
            <li>
                "remote" holds the name of the URL of an online copy of the repository
            </li>
            <li>
                "origin" holds the url of a cloned repository
            </li>
            <li>
                "git fetch" updates your remote tracking branches (local on your machine)
            </li>
            <li>
                If the remote repo has branches you don't have, you need to fetch and merge before pushing
            </li>
